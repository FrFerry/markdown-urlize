A more liberal autolink extension for python Markdown
- inspired by Django's urlize function`

Requires: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown

To play nicely with Django, drop ``urlize.py`` into your PYTHONPATH or projects root directory as ``mdx_urlize.py`` for Django's Markup app to properly load this as an extension.
